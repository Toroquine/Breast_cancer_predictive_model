# Predictive Modelling for Breast Cancer Disease Progression

## Overview
This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict the progression of breast cancer based on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The goal is to improve diagnostic accuracy and assist clinicians in identifying whether a tumor is benign or malignant.

By employing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and other machine learning models, the project evaluates predictive accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Explainable AI (SHAP) is used to provide insights into the key features influencing predictions.
